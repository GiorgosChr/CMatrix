# CMatrix
A matrix class in C++ for performing various matrix operations

## Goals

- Perform <span style="text-decoration:line-through;"> matrix calculations (Addition, scalar multiplication, transposition, and matrix multiplication)</span>

- Matrix inversion (Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition, Iterative methods, such as the Jacobi method or Gauss-Seidel method, and possibly Multigrid methods for large matrices)

- Matrix calculations using complex matrices

- Eigenvalues/ Eigenvectors calculation
