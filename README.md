# CMatrix
A matrix class in C++ for performing various matrix operations

## ToDo

- [x] Matrix operations (Addition, scalar multiplication, transposition, and matrix multiplication)
- [ ] Eigenvalue - Eigenvector calculation (Jacobi and Gram-Schmidt methods)
- [ ] Matrix inversion (Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition, Iterative methods, such as the Jacobi method or Gauss-Seidel method, and possibly Multigrid methods for large matrices)
