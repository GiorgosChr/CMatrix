# CMatrix
A matrix class in C++ for performing various matrix operations

## Goals

- Perform matrix calculations (Addition, scalar multiplication, complex conjugation, transposition and conjugate transposition)
- Matrix multiplication
- Matrix inversion (Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition, Iterative methods, such as the Jacobi method or Gauss-Seidel method and possibly Multigrid methods for large matrices)
